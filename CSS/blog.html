                    If you’re a travel blogger or aspiring to become one, you might have come across attractive, visually appealing Instagram pages or TikTok accounts of travel bloggers.

But, if you want to take your blogging for travelers to the next level, social media might not be enough!

While social media engagement is a great way to interact with users, share experiences, and even monetize content, it also has a glass ceiling on your growth.

For one, there are millions of Instagram and TikTok users you’re competing with. Moreover, once you’ve grown to a few thousand followers, they might be looking for more detailed content to follow your journey and get insights into new travel experiences.

In our experience, the best way to complement your social media presence is through a professional website!
